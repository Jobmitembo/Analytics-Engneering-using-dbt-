# Analytics Engineering with dbt and Snowflake

## Overview
This repository contains code for analytics engineering using dbt (data build tool) and Snowflake. Analytics engineering involves transforming raw data into actionable insights through the use of data modeling, transformation, and analysis techniques.

## What is Analytics Engineering?
Analytics engineering is the process of building and maintaining data pipelines and models to enable data-driven decision-making within organizations. It involves transforming raw data into structured, reliable, and accessible formats for analysis and reporting purposes.

## What is dbt?
dbt (data build tool) is an open-source tool that enables analytics engineers and data analysts to transform data in their warehouses using SQL. It provides a workflow for managing data transformation pipelines, version control, documentation, and testing, allowing for efficient and collaborative development of data models.

## What is Snowflake?
Snowflake is a cloud-based data warehousing platform that allows organizations to store and analyze large volumes of data with scalability and performance. It offers features such as data sharing, data replication, and support for diverse workloads, making it a popular choice for modern data analytics and engineering.
